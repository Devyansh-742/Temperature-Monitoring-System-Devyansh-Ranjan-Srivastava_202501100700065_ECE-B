#Temperature Monitoring System
*Overview

The Temperature Monitoring System is a simple Python program developed to simulate an IoT-based temperature monitoring system.

*The program:

• Accepts minimum and maximum temperature limits from      the user.
• Generates random temperature values (0–100°C)
• Produces a new reading every 2 seconds
• Compares the temperature with set limits
• Displays alert messages when temperature crosses safe limits

*This project demonstrates basic Python concepts such as:
• Variables
• Input/Output operations
• Loops
• Conditional statements
• Random number generation
• Time delay functions

*Objectives

• To understand user input handling in Python
• To simulate IoT temperature data using random values
• To compare real-time values with threshold limits
• To implement conditional alert logic
• To display formatted and user-friendly output

*Program Features

✔ Accepts Minimum and Maximum temperature limits
✔ Validates user input (Min < Max)
✔ Generates temperature readings every 2 seconds
✔ Displays alert messages:

 "Alert: Temperature is too high" (if temperature > max limit)

 "Alert: Temperature is too low" (if temperature < min limit)
"Temperature is Normal" (if within range)

*Technologies Used

•Programming Language: Python 3
Modules Used:

•random (for generating temperature values)

•time (for 2-second delay simulation)

•Platform: Command Line / Any Python IDE (IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

*Concepts Applied

• Random Data Simulation
• Threshold Monitoring Logic
• Infinite / Controlled Loop Execution
• Input Validation
• Real-time System Simulation

*Sample Working

•User enters minimum and maximum temperature limits.

•System generates temperature reading every 2 seconds.

•If temperature exceeds limits, alert message is displayed.

•If temperature is within limits, normal status is displayed.
